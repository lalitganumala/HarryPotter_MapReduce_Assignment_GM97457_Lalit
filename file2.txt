“I’d	be	careful	if	I	were	you,	Potter,”	he	said	slowly.	“Unless	you’re	a	bit
politer	you’ll	go	the	same	way	as	your	parents.	They	didn’t	know	what	was
good	for	them,	either.	You	hang	around	with	riffraff	like	the	Weasleys	and	that
Hagrid,	and	it’ll	rub	off	on	you.”
Both	Harry	and	Ron	stood	up.
“Say	that	again,”	Ron	said,	his	face	as	red	as	his	hair.
“Oh,	you’re	going	to	fight	us,	are	you?”	Malfoy	sneered.
“Unless	you	get	out	now,”	said	Harry,	more	bravely	than	he	felt,	because
Crabbe	and	Goyle	were	a	lot	bigger	than	him	or	Ron.
“But	we	don’t	feel	like	leaving,	do	we,	boys?	We’ve	eaten	all	our	food	and
you	still	seem	to	have	some.”
Goyle	reached	toward	the	Chocolate	Frogs	next	to	Ron	—	Ron	leapt
forward,	but	before	he’d	so	much	as	touched	Goyle,	Goyle	let	out	a	horrible
yell.
Scabbers	the	rat	was	hanging	off	his	finger,	sharp	little	teeth	sunk	deep	into
Goyle’s	knuckle	—	Crabbe	and	Malfoy	backed	away	as	Goyle	swung
Scabbers	round	and	round,	howling,	and	when	Scabbers	finally	flew	off	and
hit	the	window,	all	three	of	them	disappeared	at	once.	Perhaps	they	thought
there	were	more	rats	lurking	among	the	sweets,	or	perhaps	they’d	heard
footsteps,	because	a	second	later,	Hermione	Granger	had	come	in.
“What	
has
	been	going	on?”	she	said,	looking	at	the	sweets	all	over	the	floor
and	Ron	picking	up	Scabbers	by	his	tail.
“I	think	he’s	been	knocked	out,”	Ron	said	to	Harry.	He	looked	closer	at
Scabbers.	“No	—	I	don’t	believe	it	—	he’s	gone	back	to	sleep.”
And	so	he	had.
“You’ve	met	Malfoy	before?”
Harry	explained	about	their	meeting	in	Diagon	Alley.
“I’ve	heard	of	his	family,”	said	Ron	darkly.	“They	were	some	of	the	first	to
come	back	to	our	side	after	You-Know-Who	disappeared.	Said	they’d	been
bewitched.	My	dad	doesn’t	believe	it.	He	says	Malfoy’s	father	didn’t	need	an
excuse	to	go	over	to	the	Dark	Side.”	He	turned	to	Hermione.	“Can	we	help
you	with	something?”
“You’d	better	hurry	up	and	put	your	robes	on,	I’ve	just	been	up	to	the	front
to	ask	the	conductor,	and	he	says	we’re	nearly	there.	You	haven’t	been
fighting,	have	you?	You’ll	be	in	trouble	before	we	even	get	there!”
“Scabbers	has	been	fighting,	not	us,”	said	Ron,	scowling	at	her.	“Would
you	mind	leaving	while	we	change?”
“All	right	—	I	only	came	in	here	because	people	outside	are	behaving	very
childishly,	racing	up	and	down	the	corridors,”	said	Hermione	in	a	sniffy
voice.	“And	you’ve	got	dirt	on	your	nose,	by	the	way,	did	you	know?”
Ron	glared	at	her	as	she	left.	Harry	peered	out	of	the	window.	It	was	getting
dark.	He	could	see	mountains	and	forests	under	a	deep	purple	sky.	The	train
did	seem	to	be	slowing	down.
He	and	Ron	took	off	their	jackets	and	pulled	on	their	long	black	robes.
Ron’s	were	a	bit	short	for	him,	you	could	see	his	sneakers	underneath	them.
A	voice	echoed	through	the	train:	“We	will	be	reaching	Hogwarts	in	five
minutes’	time.	Please	leave	your	luggage	on	the	train,	it	will	be	taken	to	the
school	separately.”
Harry’s	stomach	lurched	with	nerves	and	Ron,	he	saw,	looked	pale	under
his	freckles.	They	crammed	their	pockets	with	the	last	of	the	sweets	and
joined	the	crowd	thronging	the	corridor.
The	train	slowed	right	down	and	finally	stopped.	People	pushed	their	way
toward	the	door	and	out	on	to	a	tiny,	dark	platform.	Harry	shivered	in	the	cold
night	air.	Then	a	lamp	came	bobbing	over	the	heads	of	the	students,	and	Harry
heard	a	familiar	voice:	“Firs’	years!	Firs’	years	over	here!	All	right	there,
Harry?”
Hagrid’s	big	hairy	face	beamed	over	the	sea	of	heads.
“C’mon,	follow	me	—	any	more	firs’	years?	Mind	yer	step,	now!	Firs’
years	follow	me!”
Slipping	and	stumbling,	they	followed	Hagrid	down	what	seemed	to	be	a
steep,	narrow	path.	It	was	so	dark	on	either	side	of	them	that	Harry	thought
there	must	be	thick	trees	there.	Nobody	spoke	much.	Neville,	the	boy	who
kept	losing	his	toad,	sniffed	once	or	twice.
“Yeh’ll	get	yer	firs’	sight	o’	Hogwarts	in	a	sec,”	Hagrid	called	over	his
shoulder,	“jus’	round	this	bend	here.”
There	was	a	loud	“Oooooh!”
The	narrow	path	had	opened	suddenly	onto	the	edge	of	a	great	black	lake.
Perched	atop	a	high	mountain	on	the	other	side,	its	windows	sparkling	in	the
starry	sky,	was	a	vast	castle	with	many	turrets	and	towers.
“No	more’n	four	to	a	boat!”	Hagrid	called,	pointing	to	a	fleet	of	little	boats
sitting	in	the	water	by	the	shore.	Harry	and	Ron	were	followed	into	their	boat
by	Neville	and	Hermione.
“Everyone	in?”	shouted	Hagrid,	who	had	a	boat	to	himself.	“Right	then	—
FORWARD!”
And	the	fleet	of	little	boats	moved	off	all	at	once,	gliding	across	the	lake,
which	was	as	smooth	as	glass.	Everyone	was	silent,	staring	up	at	the	great
castle	overhead.	It	towered	over	them	as	they	sailed	nearer	and	nearer	to	the
cliff	on	which	it	stood.
“Heads	down!”	yelled	Hagrid	as	the	first	boats	reached	the	cliff;	they	all
bent	their	heads	and	the	little	boats	carried	them	through	a	curtain	of	ivy	that
hid	a	wide	opening	in	the	cliff	face.	They	were	carried	along	a	dark	tunnel,
which	seemed	to	be	taking	them	right	underneath	the	castle,	until	they
reached	a	kind	of	underground	harbor,	where	they	clambered	out	onto	rocks
and	pebbles.
“Oy,	you	there!	Is	this	your	toad?”	said	Hagrid,	who	was	checking	the
boats	as	people	climbed	out	of	them.
“Trevor!”	cried	Neville	blissfully,	holding	out	his	hands.	Then	they
clambered	up	a	passageway	in	the	rock	after	Hagrid’s	lamp,	coming	out	at	last
onto	smooth,	damp	grass	right	in	the	shadow	of	the	castle.
They	walked	up	a	flight	of	stone	steps	and	crowded	around	the	huge,	oak
front	door.
“Everyone	here?	You	there,	still	got	yer	toad?”
Hagrid	raised	a	gigantic	fist	and	knocked	three	times	on	the	castle	door.

CHAPTER		SEVEN
THE	SORTING	HAT
he	door	swung	open	at	once.	A	tall,	black-haired	witch	in	emerald-green
robes	stood	there.	She	had	a	very	stern	face	and	Harry’s	first	thought
was	that	this	was	not	someone	to	cross.
“The	firs’	years,	Professor	McGonagall,”	said	Hagrid.
“Thank	you,	Hagrid.	I	will	take	them	from	here.”
She	pulled	the	door	wide.	The	entrance	hall	was	so	big	you	could	have	fit
the	whole	of	the	Dursleys’	house	in	it.	The	stone	walls	were	lit	with	flaming
torches	like	the	ones	at	Gringotts,	the	ceiling	was	too	high	to	make	out,	and	a
magnificent	marble	staircase	facing	them	led	to	the	upper	floors.
They	followed	Professor	McGonagall	across	the	flagged	stone	floor.	Harry
could	hear	the	drone	of	hundreds	of	voices	from	a	doorway	to	the	right	—	the
rest	of	the	school	must	already	be	here	—	but	Professor	McGonagall	showed
the	first	years	into	a	small,	empty	chamber	off	the	hall.	They	crowded	in,
standing	rather	closer	together	than	they	would	usually	have	done,	peering
about	nervously.
“Welcome	to	Hogwarts,”	said	Professor	McGonagall.	“The	start-of-term
banquet	will	begin	shortly,	but	before	you	take	your	seats	in	the	Great	Hall,
you	will	be	sorted	into	your	Houses.	The	Sorting	is	a	very	important
ceremony	because,	while	you	are	here,	your	House	will	be	something	like
your	family	within	Hogwarts.	You	will	have	classes	with	the	rest	of	your
House,	sleep	in	your	House	dormitory,	and	spend	free	time	in	your	House
common	room.
“The	four	Houses	are	called	Gryffindor,	Hufflepuff,	Ravenclaw,	and
Slytherin.	Each	House	has	its	own	noble	history	and	each	has	produced
outstanding	witches	and	wizards.	While	you	are	at	Hogwarts,	your	triumphs
will	earn	your	House	points,	while	any	rule-breaking	will	lose	House	points.
At	the	end	of	the	year,	the	House	with	the	most	points	is	awarded	the	House
Cup,	a	great	honor.	I	hope	each	of	you	will	be	a	credit	to	whichever	House
becomes	yours.
“The	Sorting	Ceremony	will	take	place	in	a	few	minutes	in	front	of	the	rest
of	the	school.	I	suggest	you	all	smarten	yourselves	up	as	much	as	you	can
while	you	are	waiting.”
Her	eyes	lingered	for	a	moment	on	Neville’s	cloak,	which	was	fastened
under	his	left	ear,	and	on	Ron’s	smudged	nose.	Harry	nervously	tried	to
flatten	his	hair.
“I	shall	return	when	we	are	ready	for	you,”	said	Professor	McGonagall.
“Please	wait	quietly.”
She	left	the	chamber.	Harry	swallowed.
“How	exactly	do	they	sort	us	into	Houses?”	he	asked	Ron.
“Some	sort	of	test,	I	think.	Fred	said	it	hurts	a	lot,	but	I	think	he	was
joking.”
Harry’s	heart	gave	a	horrible	jolt.	A	test?	In	front	of	the	whole	school?	But
he	didn’t	know	any	magic	yet	—	what	on	earth	would	he	have	to	do?	He
hadn’t	expected	something	like	this	the	moment	they	arrived.	He	looked
around	anxiously	and	saw	that	everyone	else	looked	terrified,	too.	No	one	was
talking	much	except	Hermione	Granger,	who	was	whispering	very	fast	about
all	the	spells	she’d	learned	and	wondering	which	one	she’d	need.	Harry	tried
hard	not	to	listen	to	her.	He’d	never	been	more	nervous,	never,	not	even	when
he’d	had	to	take	a	school	report	home	to	the	Dursleys	saying	that	he’d
somehow	turned	his	teacher’s	wig	blue.	He	kept	his	eyes	fixed	on	the	door.
Any	second	now,	Professor	McGonagall	would	come	back	and	lead	him	to	his
doom.
Then	something	happened	that	made	him	jump	about	a	foot	in	the	air	—
several	people	behind	him	screamed.
“What	the	—	?”
He	gasped.	So	did	the	people	around	him.	About	twenty	ghosts	had	just
streamed	through	the	back	wall.	Pearly-white	and	slightly	transparent,	they
glided	across	the	room	talking	to	one	another	and	hardly	glancing	at	the	first
years.	They	seemed	to	be	arguing.	What	looked	like	a	fat	little	monk	was
saying:	“Forgive	and	forget,	I	say,	we	ought	to	give	him	a	second	chance	—”
“My	dear	Friar,	haven’t	we	given	Peeves	all	the	chances	he	deserves?	He
gives	us	all	a	bad	name	and	you	know,	he’s	not	really	even	a	ghost	—	I	say,
what	are	you	all	doing	here?”
A	ghost	wearing	a	ruff	and	tights	had	suddenly	noticed	the	first	years.
Nobody	answered.
“New	students!”	said	the	Fat	Friar,	smiling	around	at	them.	“About	to	be
Sorted,	I	suppose?”
A	few	people	nodded	mutely.
“Hope	to	see	you	in	Hufflepuff!”	said	the	Friar.	“My	old	House,	you
know.”
“Move	along	now,”	said	a	sharp	voice.	“The	Sorting	Ceremony’s	about	to
start.”
Professor	McGonagall	had	returned.	One	by	one,	the	ghosts	floated	away
through	the	opposite	wall.
“Now,	form	a	line,”	Professor	McGonagall	told	the	first	years,	“and	follow
me.”
Feeling	oddly	as	though	his	legs	had	turned	to	lead,	Harry	got	into	line
behind	a	boy	with	sandy	hair,	with	Ron	behind	him,	and	they	walked	out	of
the	chamber,	back	across	the	hall,	and	through	a	pair	of	double	doors	into	the
Great	Hall.
Harry	had	never	even	imagined	such	a	strange	and	splendid	place.	It	was	lit
by	thousands	and	thousands	of	candles	that	were	floating	in	midair	over	four
long	tables,	where	the	rest	of	the	students	were	sitting.	These	tables	were	laid
with	glittering	golden	plates	and	goblets.	At	the	top	of	the	hall	was	another
long	table	where	the	teachers	were	sitting.	Professor	McGonagall	led	the	first
years	up	here,	so	that	they	came	to	a	halt	in	a	line	facing	the	other	students,
with	the	teachers	behind	them.	The	hundreds	of	faces	staring	at	them	looked
like	pale	lanterns	in	the	flickering	candlelight.	Dotted	here	and	there	among
the	students,	the	ghosts	shone	misty	silver.	Mainly	to	avoid	all	the	staring
eyes,	Harry	looked	upward	and	saw	a	velvety	black	ceiling	dotted	with	stars.
He	heard	Hermione	whisper,	“It’s	bewitched	to	look	like	the	sky	outside.	I
read	about	it	in	
Hogwarts:	A	History.
”
It	was	hard	to	believe	there	was	a	ceiling	there	at	all,	and	that	the	Great
Hall	didn’t	simply	open	on	to	the	heavens.
Harry	quickly	looked	down	again	as	Professor	McGonagall	silently	placed
a	four-legged	stool	in	front	of	the	first	years.	On	top	of	the	stool	she	put	a
pointed	wizard’s	hat.	This	hat	was	patched	and	frayed	and	extremely	dirty.
Aunt	Petunia	wouldn’t	have	let	it	in	the	house.
Maybe	they	had	to	try	and	get	a	rabbit	out	of	it,
	Harry	thought	wildly,	that
seemed	the	sort	of	thing	—	noticing	that	everyone	in	the	hall	was	now	staring
at	the	hat,	he	stared	at	it,	too.	For	a	few	seconds,	there	was	complete	silence.
Then	the	hat	twitched.	A	rip	near	the	brim	opened	wide	like	a	mouth	—	and
the	hat	began	to	sing:
“Oh,	you	may	not	think	I’m	pretty,
But	don’t	judge	on	what	you	see,
I’ll	eat	myself	if	you	can	find
A	smarter	hat	than	me.
You	can	keep	your	bowlers	black,
Your	top	hats	sleek	and	tall,
For	I’m	the	Hogwarts	Sorting	Hat
And	I	can	cap	them	all.
There’s	nothing	hidden	in	your	head
The	Sorting	Hat	can’t	see,
So	try	me	on	and	I	will	tell	you
Where	you	ought	to	be.
You	might	belong	in	Gryffindor,
Where	dwell	the	brave	at	heart,
Their	daring,	nerve,	and	chivalry
Set	Gryffindors	apart;
You	might	belong	in	Hufflepuff,
Where	they	are	just	and	loyal,
Those	patient	Hufflepuffs	are	true
And	unafraid	of	toil;
Or	yet	in	wise	old	Ravenclaw,
If	you’ve	a	ready	mind,
Where	those	of	wit	and	learning,
Will	always	find	their	kind;
Or	perhaps	in	Slytherin
You’ll	make	your	real	friends,
Those	cunning	folk	use	any	means
To	achieve	their	ends.
So	put	me	on!	Don’t	be	afraid!
And	don’t	get	in	a	flap!
You’re	in	safe	hands	(though	I	have	none)
For	I’m	a	Thinking	Cap!”
The	whole	hall	burst	into	applause	as	the	hat	finished	its	song.	It	bowed	to
each	of	the	four	tables	and	then	became	quite	still	again.
“So	we’ve	just	got	to	try	on	the	hat!”	Ron	whispered	to	Harry.	“I’ll	kill
Fred,	he	was	going	on	about	wrestling	a	troll.”
Harry	smiled	weakly.	Yes,	trying	on	the	hat	was	a	lot	better	than	having	to
do	a	spell,	but	he	did	wish	they	could	have	tried	it	on	without	everyone
watching.	The	hat	seemed	to	be	asking	rather	a	lot;	Harry	didn’t	feel	brave	or
quick-witted	or	any	of	it	at	the	moment.	If	only	the	hat	had	mentioned	a
House	for	people	who	felt	a	bit	queasy,	that	would	have	been	the	one	for	him.
Professor	McGonagall	now	stepped	forward	holding	a	long	roll	of
parchment.
“When	I	call	your	name,	you	will	put	on	the	hat	and	sit	on	the	stool	to	be
sorted,”	she	said.	“Abbott,	Hannah!”
A	pink-faced	girl	with	blonde	pigtails	stumbled	out	of	line,	put	on	the	hat,
which	fell	right	down	over	her	eyes,	and	sat	down.	A	moment’s	pause	—
“HUFFLEPUFF!”	shouted	the	hat.
The	table	on	the	right	cheered	and	clapped	as	Hannah	went	to	sit	down	at
the	Hufflepuff	table.	Harry	saw	the	ghost	of	the	Fat	Friar	waving	merrily	at
her.
“Bones,	Susan!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”	shouted	the	hat	again,	and	Susan	scuttled	off	to	sit	next
to	Hannah.
“Boot,	Terry!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
The	table	second	from	the	left	clapped	this	time;	several	Ravenclaws	stood
up	to	shake	hands	with	Terry	as	he	joined	them.
“Brocklehurst,	Mandy”	went	to	Ravenclaw	too,	but	“Brown,	Lavender”
became	the	first	new	Gryffindor,	and	the	table	on	the	far	left	exploded	with
